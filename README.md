# my-knr-solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises within "The C Programming Language" (2nd Edition) by Kernighan and Ritchie.

I aim to avoid all use of language features or concepts that haven't been introduced before the point at which the exercise is presented to the reader, within reason. "Within reason" can probably be defined here as anything that a relatively new programmer making their way through the book would be unlikely to naturally conceive without a lot of external input or prior experience.
